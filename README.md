# Biological network proximity
*  This is the implementation of proximity on the interactome.
   *  Packages reguired: *Pandas* and *NetworkX*   
*  Proximity is used to repurpose drugs treating the diseases that have limited therapeutic options (targets) 
*  Applications: 
   *  Use proximity between prognostic lncRNAs and lung adenocarcinoma to repurpose drugs. Paper entitled **LncTx: A network-based method to repurpose drugs acting on the survival-related lncRNAs in lung cancer**
